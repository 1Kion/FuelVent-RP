# FuelVent-RP
This adds a vapor vent mod using the RealPlume and SmokeScreen mod for visual effects.
NOTE: This is my first collaboration with another KSP mod developer, so a big thanks to Katniss for making this thing possible!

Credit to Katniss for the original configs and for the help to bring this into stock KSP!
